# DIYary
This is a Java JSP/Servlet base project that I created so that I could give my friends a (really) basic introduction to web development.

## Am I following the best practices out there?

Most likely not. I did separate the files into different packages (servlets, models, and daos) and tried to organize it a little bit.
